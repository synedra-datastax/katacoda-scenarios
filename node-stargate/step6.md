# Introducing @astrajs

Now, let's get to the Node.js part!  We have a couple of libraries to help you make calls to our APIs, a rest client and one for the document API.

**Objectives**
In this step we will:
1. Install @astrajs
2. Get a node.js file
3. Explore the code
4. Run the code with node

### 1. Install @astrajs

@astrajs/rest and @astrajs/collections are the two node libraries you'll be working with in this step.

First, install the libraries.

`npm install @astrajs/collections @astrajs/rest@0.0.12 sleep`{{execute}}

Head back to the Astra Connect page for your database and copy the configuration block again, and paste it right in the terminal.

### 2. Grab the cavemen.js file

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/synedra-datastax/ExploringStargate/main/cavemen.js`

Click on your new file in the file explorer to see what's there.
